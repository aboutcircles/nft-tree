## Circles Tree NFT

Circles 1k NFT tree collection - a unique project that combines art, community participation, and circles. The collection consists of 1000 generated NFTs that form individual blocks of a larger construct, such as a tree. As donors send CRC to the treasury address, sequentially minted NFTs with unique artwork are assigned to each donor, filling in the corresponding spaces on the tree. The end result is an interactive experience that showcases the power of collective effort ðŸ™‚
